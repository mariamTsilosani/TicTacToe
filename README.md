# TicTacToe

This is a simple python GUI Tic Tac Toe that I quickly put together. I haven't had any experience with python GUI beforehand so I figured this was a good place to start at. I hope I will have more time in the future to add more features to this application.

This game is very basic, it asks two users to enter their names, starts the game letting each user go after another, checks if it's a win after every move and once a player wins it prints out the winner, in case all the available spaces get filled without a win then it prints out, letting the users know that it's a tie. It also has an option to start a new game once you are done with one without restarting the program.
